# Credit_Risk_Analysis

**Using Machine Learning to solving a real-world problem: credit card risk.**

## **Overview**

**The purpose of this assignment is use Supervised Machine Learning to test how models are able to assess credit card risk. Models such as RandomOverSampler, SMOTE,
CluserCentroids, SMOTEENN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, & EasyEnsembleClassifier are all included.**

## **Machine Learning Results:**

### **Random OverSampling**

***Balanced Accuracy Score:*** **â‰ˆ65%**

**High risk Performace:**
- **precision is very low (0.01)**

- **recall is good (0.61)**

**Low risk Performace:**
- **precision is very low (1.00)**

- **recall is good (0.68)**
